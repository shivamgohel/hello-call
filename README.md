## üßæ About

**helloCall** is a lightweight, multi-party video chat application built with **React, WebRTC, PeerJS, and Socket.io**. It allows real-time video and audio communication between users in a room, using a **local signaling server built with Express**, making it **SFU-ready**.

This project demonstrates WebRTC concepts, NAT traversal with ICE, SFU-based media forwarding, and client-side management of peer streams using React context and reducers.

## ‚úÖ Core Features

### 1. Multi-Party Video Chat

- Create or join rooms instantly.
- Real-time video/audio streaming.
- Each client uploads **one outgoing stream** and receives streams from others.
- Scales efficiently with **SFU architecture**.

### 2. SFU Architecture

- SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) **forwards media streams** to all clients except the sender.
- Ensures each client uploads only **one stream**, regardless of participant count.

```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Client A] -->|Upload Stream| SFU[helloCall SFU Server]
        B[Client B] -->|Upload Stream| SFU
        C[Client C] -->|Upload Stream| SFU

        SFU -->|Forward Stream| A
        SFU -->|Forward Stream| B
        SFU -->|Forward Stream| C

        style SFU fill:#f96,stroke:#333
        style A fill:#9cf,stroke:#333
        style B fill:#9cf,stroke:#333
        style C fill:#9cf,stroke:#333
```

Each client in **helloCall** captures its local media stream (camera and microphone) and uploads it to the **SFU server**.  
The SFU acts as a **media router**, not a mixer ‚Äî it receives each user‚Äôs incoming stream and **selectively forwards** it to all other connected clients in the same room.

This design ensures that:

- üí° Every participant **uploads only one stream**, reducing upstream bandwidth usage.
- ‚öôÔ∏è The SFU handles **efficient distribution** of streams to all peers.
- üìà The architecture scales better than full-mesh (P2P-to-everyone) models.
- üé• Clients receive multiple incoming streams ‚Äî one from each other participant ‚Äî while maintaining smooth real-time performance.

In essence, **helloCall** implements a **lightweight SFU-style WebRTC architecture** where the **Express + Socket.io** signaling layer coordinates connections,  
and **PeerJS** handles the actual media exchange between peers through this forwarding mechanism.

### 3. WebRTC Connection Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C1 as Client 1
    participant SS as Signaling Server
    participant STUN as STUN Server
    participant C2 as Client 2
    participant TURN as TURN Server

    C1->>SS: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect via Socket.io
    C2->>SS: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect via Socket.io

    par ICE Gathering
        C1->>STUN: 2Ô∏è‚É£ Get public IP
        C2->>STUN: 2Ô∏è‚É£ Get public IP
    end

    C1->>SS: 3Ô∏è‚É£ Send SDP Offer
    SS->>C2: Forward SDP Offer
    C2->>SS: Send SDP Answer
    SS->>C1: Forward SDP Answer

    C1-->C2: 4Ô∏è‚É£ Direct P2P Connection
    Note over C1,C2: WebRTC Media Stream

    alt NAT Traversal Fails
        C1-->TURN: 5Ô∏è‚É£ Fallback to TURN
        TURN-->C2: Relay Connection
    end
```

The connection flow in helloCall follows standard WebRTC practices:

1. Clients connect to the signaling server via Socket.io
2. Both clients discover their public IP addresses using STUN servers
3. They exchange SDP (Session Description Protocol) offers and answers through the signaling server
4. A direct peer-to-peer connection is established for media streaming
5. If NAT traversal fails, the connection falls back to TURN server relay

This ensures reliable connectivity across different network configurations while prioritizing direct P2P connections when possible.

---

## üèÅ Conclusion

helloCall demonstrates a practical, lightweight SFU-style WebRTC architecture that prioritizes direct P2P connections. It‚Äôs designed for clarity, extensibility, and real-time performance in multi-party video scenarios.
